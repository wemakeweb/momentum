# install

Momentumjs requires `nodejs` or `iojs` to be installed. We currently support only `rethinkdb` as database, that will change in the future. To install succesfull install `momentumjs` following the following steps:

```bash
$ npm install momentumjs
```

add the momentumjs comandline interface to your `package.json` scripts field like so:

```json

{
	"scripts": {
    	"momentumjs": "momentumjs"
  	}
}

```

than run:

```bash
$ mommentumjs run
```
