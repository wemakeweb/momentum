# Installation

Momentumjs requires `nodejs` or `iojs` to be installed. We currently support only `rethinkdb` as database, that will change in the future. To successfully install `momentumjs` follow the steps:

```bash
$ npm install momentumjs --save
```

add the momentumjs executable to your `package.json` scripts field like so:

```json

{
	"scripts": {
    	"momentumjs": "momentumjs"
  	}
}

```

than run:

```bash
$ momentumjs create
```
This will create a basic application skeleton to start your development. Then run the development server and your ready to go!
```bash
$ momentumjs run
```
